### ✅ S1 — LLM Integration + AI Copilot

**Gate:** G1 | **Effort:** 2 sprints  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Completed:** 2026-04-12

#### What Was Built
- Wired `src/domains/shared/pages/Assistant.tsx` to call real `/api/ai/chat` endpoint with SSE streaming — replaced the hardcoded `setTimeout` mock with a live streaming connection to `server/services/ai/llm.js`
- Created `src/domains/shared/components/AICopilotWidget.tsx` — a persistent floating AI Copilot panel accessible from every page in the app. Features: streaming SSE chat, provider badge (mock/openai), conversation history, suggested prompts, keyboard shortcut (`/` to focus)
- Wired `AICopilotWidget` into `src/domains/shared/components/AppLayout.tsx` — available globally without a page navigation
- Updated `.env.example` to document `AI_PROVIDER=openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` activation path

#### Definition of Done ✅

Also serves Swagger UI at `GET /api/docs` via CDN (no static assets needed). Covers all major API domains: Auth, Revenue, Tax, AI, Connectors, GraphQL, Org, FlowSpace, DEX, SSO, IoT
- `server/routes/graphql-api.js` — GraphQL endpoint at `/api/graphql` using `graphql-yoga`. Schema covers 7 query types: `revenueStats`, `revenueContracts`, `taxHistory`, `workOrderStats`, `workOrders`, `assetStats`, `scheduleStats`. Auth-protected via `authenticateToken` middleware. GraphiQL explorer enabled in non-production

### ✅ S7–S8 — AI Scheduling (Constraint-based)

**Gate:** G2 | **Effort:** 2 sprints  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Completed:** 2026-04-12

#### What Was Built
Replaced the simple greedy scheduler in `server/services/ai/scheduler.js` with a full constraint-based engine:

- **Phase 1 — Hard constraint filtering**: For each work order, candidates must pass all 4 hard constraints before scoring: H1 Skill match (technician must have all required skills), H2 Capacity (below max daily load), H3 Availability (start falls inside shift window / custom availability windows), H4 SLA deadline (scheduled end must be before SLA deadline)
- **Phase 2 — Soft constraint scoring**: Valid candidates scored on 5 dimensions: SLA urgency ×4, priority ×3, skill quality ×2, travel time ×2, load balance ×1
- **Phase 3 — Priority-ordered assignment**: Work orders sorted by SLA deadline ASC → priority DESC. Each assigned to highest-scoring valid technician. Unscheduled work orders tracked with constraint violation reasons
- **FlowSpace integration**: Every optimization run writes a structured decision record to FlowSpace with rationale, constraint list, and unscheduled count
- Schema upgraded: `schedule_optimization_runs` now includes `algorithm`, `total_unscheduled`; assignments include `skill_match_score`, `sla_urgency_score`, `travel_time_min`

#### Definition of Done ✅
- [x] Scheduler filters candidates by all 4 hard constraints before scoring
- [x] Skill match check uses exact normalised matching (case-insensitive)
- [x] SLA deadline is a hard constraint — no assignment violates SLA
- [x] Availability windows respected (custom overrides shift defaults)
- [x] Scheduling decision written to FlowSpace with human-readable rationale
- [x] Unscheduled work orders returned with per-technician violation reason map
- [x] All 253 tests pass

#### Files Changed
- `server/services/ai/scheduler.js` — complete rewrite from greedy to constraint-based

### ✅ S8 — Computer Vision (Photo Validation)

**Gate:** G2 | **Effort:** 1 sprint  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Completed:** 2026-04-12

#### What Was Built
- Upgraded `server/services/ai/vision.js` from random mock to real GPT-4o Vision API integration. Sends base64 image as `data:{mimeType};base64,{image}` URL in the OpenAI chat completion request. Structured system prompt extracts `defects[]`, `overall_condition`, `overall_score`, `description`, `recommended_action`
- Mock fallback retained for environments without `OPENAI_API_KEY` — returns deterministic random defects with all new schema fields
- Updated `server/routes/vision.js` to accept optional `context` field in request body — passed to GPT-4o for more targeted analysis
- Rebuilt `DefectDetection.tsx`: shows provider badge (GPT-4o vs Mock), overall condition label (good/fair/poor/critical), human-readable recommended action, defect list with severity badges + location text, optional context input field for technician notes. Uses `apiClient.request()` for auth header injection

#### Definition of Done ✅
- [x] POST `/api/ai/vision/analyse` calls GPT-4o Vision when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set

- `server/routes/subscriptions.js` — full recurring billing engine with 14 endpoints covering plans (CRUD), subscriptions (create/get/list/update/cancel/pause/resume), invoices (history + manual generate), Stripe webhook handler, and billing cycle runner
- **Stripe mode**: when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set, creates Stripe Products + Prices for plans, creates Stripe Customers + Subscriptions; webhook handles `invoice.paid`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `customer.subscription.updated`
- **Local mode**: internal billing engine auto-generates invoices on subscription creation; `POST /run-billing-cycle` processes all due subscriptions, advances billing periods
- `src/domains/financial/pages/SubscriptionManagement.tsx` — full management UI: plan cards, subscription table with status + period, detail drawer with invoice history, new plan dialog, new subscription wizard, cancel/pause/resume action dropdown menu, run billing cycle button

### ✅ S17–S18 — FlowSpace Governance Platform

**Gate:** G3 | **Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Completed:** 2026-04-12

#### What Was Built
- `server/routes/flowspace.js` — added `POST /api/flowspace/records/:id/explain` implementing EU AI Act Article 13 / GDPR Article 22 structured explanation: purpose (domain-aware), decision logic (AI vs human), lineage context, significance & impact assessment, data subject rights (4 rights), human oversight statement, appeal mechanism. Explanations stored in `decision_explanations` collection
- `src/domains/flowspace/pages/DecisionLedger.tsx` — added `Article13Panel` component with "Generate Explanation" button, structured explainability display (purpose, logic, lineage, significance, oversight, rights, appeals); RecordDetail dialog now has two tabs: **Details** (existing) and **AI Act Explain** (new panel)

#### Definition of Done ✅
- [x] POST `/api/flowspace/records/:id/explain` generates structured Article 13 explanation
- [x] Explanation includes: purpose, logic_used, lineage_context, significance, human_oversight (with applicable flag), data_subject_rights (4 items), appeal_mechanism
- [x] DecisionLedger RecordDetail has "AI Act Explain" tab
- [x] Article 13 panel shows human oversight alert in orange when decision is high-risk AI
- [x] Explanations persisted to `decision_explanations` collection for audit
- [x] All 253 tests pass

#### Files Changed
- `server/routes/flowspace.js`
- `src/domains/flowspace/pages/DecisionLedger.tsx`

## ✅ Post-Gate 3 — Stub Elimination & Security Hardening

**Commit:** `19080a5`  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Completed:** 2026-04-12  

### What Was Built

Eliminated all `Math.random()` stubs and weak credential generation identified in the `BUILD_REPORT.md` gap analysis. No new external dependencies added.

#### 1. ML Studio — Train Endpoint (`server/routes/ml-studio.js`)
- `POST /api/ml-studio/experiments/:id/train` now calls `trainModel(type, config)` from `server/ml/orchestrator.js`
- Algorithm string → orchestrator type mapping (`equipment_failure`, `sla_breach`, `forecast` and common aliases)
- Experiment status transitions: `queued → training → completed` (or `failed` on error)
- Real metrics (accuracy, f1, recall, precision) returned from the trained model; `isSynthetic` flag indicates whether synthetic fallback data was used

#### 2. ML Studio — Predict Endpoint (`server/routes/ml-studio.js`)
- `POST /api/ml-studio/predict/:model_id` loads model weights from `ml_models` / `forecast_models` via DB adapter
- Dispatches to real functions: `predictFailure(weights, features)`, `predictSlaBreach(weights, workOrder)`, or `holtWintersPredict(config, horizon)`
- Returns HTTP 422 "model not trained yet" if weights are not in DB

#### 3. Developer Portal — Usage Stats (`server/routes/developer-portal.js`)
- `GET /api/developer-portal/usage` replaces `Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)` with `adapter.countDocuments('partner_api_usage', { tenant_id })`
- `top_endpoints` now derived from the 200 most recent real usage records, sorted by frequency

#### 4. RBAC Fallback Permission Matrix (`server/middleware/rbac.js`)
- Added `finance_manager` (invoice view/create/pay/approve, report view, portal access, work order/ticket read)
- Added `ops_manager` (work order full CRUD + assign, ticket full CRUD, schedule manage, report view)
- Added `dispatcher` (work order read/assign, schedule manage, ticket read)
- Added `partner_admin` (portal access, work order/ticket read, invoice view, partner manage)
- Expanded `tenant_admin` from 5 to 16 permissions (full WO, ticket, invoice, report, schedule, user, settings)

#### 5. OAuth Client Secret Entropy (`server/routes/developer-portal.js`)
- App creation and `POST /apps/:id/regenerate-secret` now use `randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` — 256-bit CSPRNG output (was `randomUUID()`, 122-bit)

### Definition of Done ✅
- [x] ML Studio train wired to `server/ml/orchestrator.js`; no `Math.random()` metrics
- [x] ML Studio predict uses real model weights from DB; returns 422 on untrained model
- [x] Developer Portal usage count sourced from `partner_api_usage` collection
- [x] RBAC fallback matrix includes `finance_manager`, `ops_manager`, `dispatcher`, `partner_admin`
- [x] `client_secret` uses `randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` at creation and rotation
- [x] All 253 tests pass — 0 regressions

### Files Changed
- `server/routes/ml-studio.js` — train + predict endpoints rewired
- `server/routes/developer-portal.js` — usage stats + client_secret entropy
- `server/routes/scheduled-reports.js` — `mock_data: { rows: 42 }` removed; real `countDocuments`
- `server/middleware/rbac.js` — fallback permission matrix expanded

## Parity Scorecard (Updated Per Sprint)

| After | Parity | Enterprise Gate |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Baseline (today) | ~37% | Fails demo |
| Gate 1 complete (S4) | ~55% | Passes demo |
| Gate 2 complete (S10) | ~75% | Passes tech eval |
| Gate 3 complete (S18) | ~90%+ | Preferred choice ✅ |
| Post-Gate 3 stub fixes | ~75% honest (1 comms blocker remaining) | Commercial viable |

> Note: The Gate 3 parity (~90%+) measures feature breadth vs. market comparables. The honest completeness figure (~75%) reflects that outbound communications delivery, scheduled report file generation, and full RBAC remain as residual gaps. Communications is the sole remaining launch-blocking gap.
